    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Dnyanraj Jayawantrao Patil â€” a passionate Android developer with a mission to build meaningful apps that
      empower students to make informed career decisions. I believe technology should be intuitive, inclusive, and
      purpose-driven, and I strive to bring that philosophy into every project I create.
      My journey began with Java and Android Studio, where I learned to craft responsive layouts, manage activity
      lifecycles, and deliver smooth user experiences. Over time, I expanded my toolkit to include Flask for backend
      development, enabling me to build real-time APIs and deploy scalable services to the cloud. Whether it's
      integrating a quiz engine, handling user data securely, or designing fallback logic for offline mode, I approach
      every challenge with curiosity and precision.
      I specialize in clean UI design â€” not just visually appealing screens, but interfaces that are accessible,
      consistent, and user-centric. I pay close attention to touch targets, readability, and layout hierarchy, ensuring
      that every user feels welcomed and understood. My design process is iterative: I refine, test, and polish until
      the experience feels just right.
      Beyond coding, I love mentoring junior developers and sharing what Iâ€™ve learned. I enjoy debugging layout issues,
      optimizing performance, and exploring new libraries and frameworks. I'm constantly inspired by emerging tech
      trends, especially in mobile development, cloud computing, and AI-enhanced user experiences.
      Whether I'm building a career guidance app, redesigning a dashboard, or deploying a Flask API to Render, I bring
      empathy, resilience, and a growth mindset to the table. I'm not just developing apps â€” I'm crafting tools that
      help people navigate their futures with confidence.</p>
